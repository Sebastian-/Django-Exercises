A webpage displaying text stored in a database

## Topics Covered

* Database models are python objects which Django can map to tables in a database. Model objects inherit from a Django module called `models` and declare fields in which data will be stored. Each field must specify the type of data it will contain. For a simple string of text this project used `models.TextField()`, [but many other types are available](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/).
